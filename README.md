# 3d_models-web-scraper
I've writen two seperate python scripts that scrapes the data on "https://3dsky.org/".
This websites contains images of 3d models and name of the models.
The first script hits the site, screenshots the images and saves the images as the name(title) of the model, which os also goten from the site.
The second script gets the image src of the product and the name of the model and inputs them into a csv file.
